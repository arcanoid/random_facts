Since the Earth is also several million miles closer to the sun at that time of the year than in the summer, sunlight striking the moon was about 7% stronger making it brighter. Also, this was the closest perigee of the Moon of the year since the moon's orbit is constantly deforming.

If the room is too hot, the motion detector won't register a change in the radiated heat of that person's body when it enters the room and breaks the infrared beam. Your home's safety might be compromised if you turn your air conditioning off or set the thermostat too high while on summer vacation."

The day was set aside to honor all saints, known and unknown. Halloween then is a shortened form of All Hallows Eve - the evening before All Hallows Day. Certainly, you have a choice of celebrating it on Oct. 30, Saturday, if you wish. Many of the area parties will be held then rather than on Sunday. It's probably appropriate to say some people equate Halloween with the occult or Satanism and don't approve of it at all."

Charles Perrault, a Frenchman, published a collection of these rhymes in 1697 and an illustration accompanying the text showed an old woman telling stories, with the words \"Mother Goose\" appearing behind her. The book was eventually published in England and the United States and more rhymes were added with each new publication. It wasn't until the 1800's that a relative of Mrs. Goose claimed the stories originated with Elizabeth."

    "fact": "The reason wheels seem to spin backwards on a camera is because when you film something, you are really taking a series of still images and then replaying them so fast that the eye is fooled into thinking it is a continuous stream of images. The eye can see about 12-14 frames per second. Because of a physical law called the Nyquist Sampling Theorem you need to display frames twice as fast as the eye can see to fool it into seeing it as a continuous movie (Nyquist showed mathematically why that is true). So, imagine you have a wheel that is spinning exactly once every second. If you took a picture at the same rate, it would look like it is standing still. That's because it rotates exactly once every time you take a picture. Now take a picture just a little bit faster than 1 per second. Now every time you take a picture, the wheel has not quite made it all the way around; maybe it will have gone 350 degrees around, so it's 10 degrees behind the first frame. The next frame it will have gone another 350 degrees, making it now 20 degrees behind the first frame, and so on. When you play the film back, it will look like the wheel is moving backwards, even though you know it was going forwards. The opposite effect happens when you take pictures a bit slower than the rotation rate. It gets more complicated when the wheel does not rotate at a constant rate, like when a car accelerates. The next time you watch TV or go to the movies, watch the wheels as a car speeds up. You might see the wheel appear to go backwards, them stop, then go forwards, all while the car is moving forwards."

An astute collector, the cardinal recognized the work at once and bought it. Then came the real miracle. Several months later, while browsing in another back alley in Rome, Cardinal Fesch found a head of Saint Jerome that so resembled his work by Leonardo that he purchased it immediately. He brought it home and placed the head with the body. Remarkably, it fit. Thus one of the great paintings of the world was saved for posterity."

As a youth, Banvard longed to become famous, and at the age of twenty-five he concocted the scheme of painting a colossal mural depicting 1,2000 miles of landscape along the Mississippi River. Camping out along the Mississippi for more than a year, Banvard lived on hunted game and worked his way slowly upriver, making thousands of sketches as he traveled. He then returned to Louisville, built himself a studio, and furnished it with a mile of canvas. In order to keep the canvas manageable, he wrapped it around a large upright roller and pulled it out as needed, much the way one pulls paper towels off a dispenser. The part of the canvas that was painted was then rolled up on another large drum. According to people who saw the work in progress, the quality of craftsmanship was quite good, depicting, as one witness reported, “the remarkable truthfulness of the minutest objects upon the shores of the river.” On its completion in 1846, the painting was displayed in Louisville, where it was an immediate success. Banvard then took it on tour across the United States and to Great Britain. The Picture received international acclaim, and he soon became quite wealthy. When Banvard died, however, the painting disappeared. It was last seen in Watertown, South Dakota, where strips of it were bing used as a stage set. Just how good this painting actually was we will never know, for no contemporary photographs of it exist."

    "fact": "Leonardo da Vinci's painting The Last Supper is perhaps the finest known example of the High Renaissance style, and is considered one of the greatest art treasures of the world. Yet the painting as we know it today can in no way be considered an original. Leonardo painted his masterpiece on the refectory wall of the monastery of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan between 1495 and 1497. He worked at it in fits and starts, finally leaving it unfinished (the picture was largely unappreciated in its time). By 1517, the work had already been seriously damaged by dampness, and a few years later the famous art historian Vasari referred to it as “merely a mass of blots”. By the following century monks inhabiting the monastery had lost all respect for the work and had broken a doorway through Christ's legs. The painting continued to decay, and in 1796 a garrison of French soldiers occupied the monastery and quartered their horses in the same room as the painting. The soldiers whiled away the time taking target practice at Christ's head. During World War II sandbags were piled against the painting to protect it from bombing. Nonetheless, a bomb landed squarely on the monastery and demolished the building, though miraculously most of the wall on which The Last Supper was painted was spared. All this abuse, however, more or less destroyed the painting, and The Last Supper that people see today is a heavily restored work in which only the outlines and a few brush strokes are by Leonardo."
