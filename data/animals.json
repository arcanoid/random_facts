The fly swatter, however, has many holes arranged along its surface, so that it displaces little air as it bears down on its victim. Thus the fly is caught unaware."

(However, the platypus has no nipples. The mother secrets milk from stomach glands and the baby laps it up.) The platypus has a leathery, duck like bill (from which it gets the name “duck billed platypus”), and its feet are webbed like those of aquatic birds. Bu at the end of the webs are claws just like a cat's or a racoon's. After much argument, scientists finally decided that the platypus merited classification as a mammal—but only marginally."

Once they arrive at their destination, the males remain at the river mouths while the females move farther upstream, finally settling in small island lakes and ponds. They remain there for ten to fifteen years, until they receive a strange instinctive call back to the sea. Swimming against great river currents, leaping upward like salmon, sometimes leaving the water altogether to crawl along great stretches of land, the female eel finally makes her way back to the sea, where she joins the male. Then they swim together directly to the Sargasso Sea. Here they mate, spawn, and die."
